# Mixed-bagging
This repository contains the code and data for the experiments in our paper "Mixed Bagging based on Instance Hardness: A Novel Ensemble Learning Framework for Supervised Classification"

The code folder has the following programs:
  "Mixed bagging v10 code for SIGKDD18.py" : Where the proposed and traditional methods have been implemented and tested with cross-validation on the datasets
  "Mixed bag Full dataset v6 (visualizations).py" : Where the final bootsraps for the whole dataset can be built, and some visualization on the dataset is done
  "Visualize datasets.py" : For visualization of decision boundary and lwer dimensional projection
  "ih_calc.py" : To calculate Instance Hardness (IH)
  "mix_bag_library.py" : Necessary functions that other programs can import

The dataset folder contains the 47 datasets (after necessary preprocessing) used in the experiments
